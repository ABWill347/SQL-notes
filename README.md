# SQL-notes
Joins
Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns.
Types of joins:
INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table.
RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Returns all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table.
FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN): Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.



Triggers
Triggers are special types of stored procedures that are automatically executed (fired) when certain events occur in the database.
Types of triggers:
BEFORE trigger: Executes before the operation (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
AFTER trigger: Executes after the operation.
Common uses:
Enforcing business rules.
Auditing changes (logging).
Preventing unauthorized actions.



Views
Views are virtual tables derived from one or more base tables.
Characteristics:
Can be queried like regular tables.
Do not store data themselves; they are defined by a query.
Provide a layer of abstraction over the underlying schema.
Advantages:
Simplify complex queries.
Enhance security by restricting access to certain columns or rows.
Provide a consistent view of data to users.



Stored Procedures
Stored Procedures are a set of SQL statements stored in the database server and executed as a single unit.
Benefits:
Code reusability: Avoids rewriting the same SQL code multiple times.
Improved performance: Compiled and optimized once, executed many times.
Security: Permissions can be granted at the procedure level.
Parameters:
Input parameters: Passed to the procedure for processing.
Output parameters: Used to return values back to the caller.
Result sets: Generated by SELECT statements within the procedure.


Example SQL Syntax:



Joins:
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;


Triggers:
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
BEFORE INSERT ON table_name
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Trigger logic here
END;


Views:
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT columns
FROM table
WHERE condition;


Stored Procedures:
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
    @parameter1 datatype,
    @parameter2 datatype
AS
BEGIN
    -- Procedure logic here
END;
